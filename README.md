# TypeScript project
Goal is to implement an algorithm one time and reuse code as much as possible.
This Project is really good example of how Interface and classes work together in TypeScript. Also I use Abstract and inheritance classes here.

* In this project, we will be work on different DataStructure like an Array of number, a String of character and LinkedList where each node contain a number.
* In this project I take different data-sets and sort them.
Array of the number must be sorted( lowest to higest order)
String of Characters sorted in Alpabetical order( like "AByoqZp" --> "ABopqyZ")
LinkedList arrange in increasing order of each node.
* I use sorting logic here because sometimes sorting Data-sets by using different algorithm is not easy for every Engineer.
 so, by Implementing this project we only have to write a sorting algorithm that defines equally well for all very differnt DataStructures.
 
This project have two folders:
1. Build(contain JavaScript code)
2. src(contain TypeScript Code)

Also different setup files:
* node module folder
* tsconfig.json (It is used to custamize the compiler)
* package-lock.json
* package.json

Run different commands in Visual studio terminal terminal:
* npm install -g typescript
* tsc --init
* tsc -w
* npm init -y
* npm install nodemon 
* npm install concurrency
